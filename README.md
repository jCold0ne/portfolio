Welcome to the readme I hope you enjoyed the hot chocolate. 

#####Overview 
My website aims to engage and entertain the reader through imagery and humour while sharing a piece of my personality. The overall design, white text on a full screen background image, is maintained throughout the website to create a cohesive feel as the user navigates through the website. It also enables an easy path to add/edit/remove content and images from the website increasing its maintainability and future scalabilty.

#####Purpose 

My goal each day is to make atleast one person smile this website is an extension of that goal. I hope to achieve this by capturing a reader's attention through crisp imagery, concise white text and a dash of humour. In time, this website will house more meaningful content such as completed projects and actual blog posts - a platform to launch my personal brand and invite future employers. For now, this website is a playground of coding skills; html, css, javaSCRIPT and a touch of jquery (strangest syntax I've ever seen). This website was deployed with netlify.

#####Features

You must be hungry, do you like hamburgers cause I do. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54294715/65375074-ae7b3b80-dcd4-11e9-8cb3-b386fdff8fdc.png)

The hamburger menu and its animations are created using pure css located in a separate css file, menu.css. Once clicked, the hamburger menu animates and opens a list of the various pages a user can visit on my portfolio website.

The hamburger icon is fixed on every page so the user can navigate easily through the website.

Another feature are the socials buttons which animate on hover.

The user can click the buttons which link to my corresponding profile page aka. my LinkedIn page. The animation increases interactivity by notifying the user of where their cursor is placed. In addition, there is also a promise of hot chocolate (an unnoficial feature) represented by a similar animated button.

 This button links the user to the 'About' page which is a natural progression for the user. As the user scrolls through the about page they will be rewarded with a hug in a mug image.

If they continue to scroll to the bottom of the about page (the darkness page) there is another button linking the user to the blog page - continuing the natural progression through the website.

The aim of the Hot Chocolate button on the home page is to warmly invite the user into the website where I can share a little bit about myself. The hot chocolate images aims to brighten someones day and the scrolling into darkness is hopefully funny - the goal in a nutshell.

The third feature is the loading animation which will continue to play until the first page is fully loaded. This gives the user something to watch while the page loads rather than staring into a blank screen. 


It's a small feature which can have a tremendemous effect as users don't want to wait and watch a website load they just want to use the completed result. It's like the red curtains at a theatre - the production company doesn't want the audience to see the set-up they just want them to see the show.
